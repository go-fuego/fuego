# OpenTelemetry Collector Configuration Example
# This is a sample configuration for the OTEL collector

receivers:
  # OTLP receiver for receiving telemetry data from applications
  otlp:
    protocols:
      # HTTP protocol on port 4318
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
      # gRPC protocol on port 4317 (optional)
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317

processors:
  # Batch processor to batch telemetry data before export
  batch:
    timeout: 10s
    send_batch_size: 1024

  # Memory limiter to prevent the collector from running out of memory
  memory_limiter:
    check_interval: 1s
    limit_mib: 512

exporters:
  # Export metrics to Prometheus
  prometheus:
    endpoint: "0.0.0.0:8889"
    namespace: gourmet

  # Log telemetry to console (useful for debugging)
  logging:
    loglevel: info
    sampling_initial: 5
    sampling_thereafter: 200

  # Export traces to Jaeger
  otlp/jaeger:
    endpoint: "jaeger:4317"
    tls:
      insecure: true

  # Alternatively, export traces to Zipkin
  # zipkin:
  #   endpoint: "http://zipkin:9411/api/v2/spans"

  # Export to Prometheus Remote Write (e.g., Grafana Cloud, Thanos)
  # prometheusremotewrite:
  #   endpoint: "https://your-prometheus-endpoint.com/api/v1/write"
  #   headers:
  #     Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"

  # Export to Grafana Tempo for traces
  # otlp/tempo:
  #   endpoint: "tempo:4317"
  #   tls:
  #     insecure: true

service:
  # Configure the telemetry pipelines
  pipelines:
    # Metrics pipeline
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [memory_limiter, batch]
      exporters: [prometheus, logging]

    # Traces pipeline
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [memory_limiter, batch]
      exporters: [otlp/jaeger, logging]

  # Configure collector's own telemetry
  telemetry:
    logs:
      level: info
    metrics:
      address: :8888
