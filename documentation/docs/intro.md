# ðŸ”¥ Fuego
[Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/go-fuego/fuego.svg)

Let's discover **Fuego in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new go project**.

Or **try Fuego immediately** by cloning **[one of our exemples](https://github.com/go-fuego/fuego/tree/main/examples)**.

### What you'll need

- [Golang v1.22](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.22) or above:
  - Fuego relies on a new feature of the net/http package only available after 1.22.

And then blablabla
